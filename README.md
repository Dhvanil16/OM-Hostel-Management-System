# OM-Hostel-Management-System
This system was created with the hostel administration in mind, assisting them in preserving student records on their rooms and other items. They benefit from it since it saves them from having to do the manual labour required to locate records of students, student meal bills, and details about individuals who left the hostel three years earlier.
